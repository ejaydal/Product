  <h1 id="recipe">Pastillas</h1>
  <p>Pastillas or Pastillas de Leche is a milk-based confectionery which originated in the town of San Miguel in Bulacan, Philippines. Pastillas-making later spread to other regions such as in the provinces of Cagayan and Masbate. Initially, pastillas de leche were primarily home made by carabao-rearing farmers then a small-scale industry on the food product grew. Pastillas were made either from carabao or cow milk; or both. Refined sugar and lemon juice are also added during pastillas-making. </p>
